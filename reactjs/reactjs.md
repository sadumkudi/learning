## Notes
- Components - react is a component based library to build user interfaces
  - components are reusable 
  - can be nested
- JSX, Styling, Props, State, Event Handling, Lifecycle Methods, API using HTTP, Forms, 
- Virtual DOM 
  - is a javascript object{key:value} that mimics the actual DOM and it's an abstraction over DOM 
  - improve performance
  - find the difference b/w previous and current state of virtual DOM and just updates the changes to actual DOM
- React can be rendered on server-side as well
