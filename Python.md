##### Types of values
- strings are immutable, slicing of strings, concatenating strings
- int vs float: division always produces a float
- boolean: True/False {not, and, or}
- comparisons: ==, !=, <=, >=
- Lists: 
  - sequence of values, need not be uniform
  - extract values by position, can be sliced
  - for lists, a single position returns a value, slice returns a list
  - list can contain other lists - nesting
  - lists are mutable
  - for immutable values, assignment makes a fresh copy of a value
  - for mutable values, assignment does not make a fresh copy
